# Sales-Project
## Project Overview:
This project involved preparing and analyzing an Amazon Sales dataset to extract meaningful insights by first addressing data quality issues.

### Key Tasks:
## Data Cleaning:
- Identified and handled missing values with appropriate methodology
- Performed string manipulation to fix inconsistencies in text fields
- Handled duplicate entries
- Standardize few feature names, merged multiple name variations into single, consistent values.

## Data Preparation:
- Sorted the dataset to improve readability and analysis
- Ensured all categorical and numerical fields were structured appropriately

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Uncovered sales trends, regional performance, and product-level insights
- Applied conditional formatting to highlight key metrics, anomalies, and patterns in the data.

### Next Steps:
I plan to continue this project in Tableau to enhance insights into regional performance, shipping services, sales trends, products performance, and to build interactive dashboards for more dynamic and accessible business insights.
